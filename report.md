# **Iris Classification Report**

## **Overview**
In this project, I developed and trained a neural network to classify the Iris dataset into three categories based on flower features. The process involved data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and saving the model for future use. Here’s what I learned through this experience:

---

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Feature and Label Separation**: I learned how to separate features (`X`) and labels (`y`) from a dataset.
- **Label Encoding**: By using `LabelEncoder`, I encoded categorical labels into numerical format and applied one-hot encoding to make them suitable for multi-class classification.
- **Feature Standardization**: I used `StandardScaler` to scale the input features, which is crucial for ensuring faster and more stable training of the neural network.

### 2. **Model Building**
- **Sequential Model**: I learned to build a neural network using the Keras `Sequential` API. The network comprised:
  - Input layer for 4 features.
  - Hidden layers with ReLU activation for non-linear transformations.
  - Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class probabilities.
- **Layer Design**: Choosing the number of neurons in each layer and experimenting with the architecture was an insightful process.

### 3. **Model Training**
- **Compilation**: I used the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, which are commonly used for multi-class classification problems.
- **Validation**: Splitting a part of the training data for validation helped me monitor overfitting and assess the model's performance during training.
- **Batch Size and Epochs**: I observed how these hyperparameters impact the speed and accuracy of training.

### 4. **Evaluation**
- **Metrics**: Evaluating the model on the test set using loss and accuracy provided a quantitative measure of its performance.
- **Overfitting**: I noticed signs of overfitting during training, which taught me the importance of using techniques like early stopping and dropout.

## **How the Neural Network Makes Decisions**

1. **Input Layer**:  
   The input layer receives the features of the flower (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). These features are scaled to ensure consistency and fed into the network.

2. **Hidden Layers**:  
   - Each hidden layer applies a series of weights and biases to the inputs and transforms them using the ReLU activation function.  
   - This process enables the network to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data.  
   - Neurons in each layer work together to detect specific features that distinguish one flower type from another.

3. **Output Layer**:  
   - The final layer uses the softmax activation function to calculate the probabilities of each class (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).  
   - The class with the highest probability is selected as the network’s prediction.

4. **Forward Propagation**:  
   - Data flows through the network from input to output, with each neuron contributing to the final decision by performing mathematical operations (weighted sums).

5. **Learning through Backpropagation**:  
   - The network calculates the error between its predicted output and the actual label.  
   - Gradients of the error with respect to the weights are computed using backpropagation.  
   - These gradients are used to update the weights through optimization (Adam), improving the accuracy of future predictions.

## **Challenges**
- **Overfitting**: With a small dataset like Iris, overfitting happened quickly. I realized the importance of regularization techniques like dropout and learning rate adjustments.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Deciding on the number of neurons, layers, and other hyperparameters required iterative experimentation and analysis.

## **Additional Insights**
- **Visualization**: Plotting training and validation accuracy/loss helped me identify trends in model performance over epochs.
- **Model Optimization**: Exploring callbacks like `EarlyStopping` and `ReduceLROnPlateau` provided better control over the training process.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Beyond accuracy, using tools like confusion matrices and classification reports can give deeper insights into model performance.

## **Future Directions**
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning using tools like Keras Tuner.
- Explore more complex datasets to build and train larger neural networks.
- Deploy the trained model in a web or mobile application for real-world use cases.
- Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment.
